# CR‑BPS Project Understanding – Example Library

These excerpts show how past CR‑BPS proposals frame the **“Project Understanding”** section. They demonstrate the firm’s practice of: (1) restating the client’s goals and context, (2) signaling CR‑BPS’s relevant expertise, and (3) setting the stage for the Scope of Services. Use them as style and structure references when drafting new proposals.

### Example 1 – FSAM & Asset Management Plans

CR‑BPS SPECIALIZES IN FSAM AND ASSET MANAGEMENT PLANS\*\*

CR‑BPS is an industry leader in conducting comprehensive facility and site assessments and developing asset management plans. We are dedicated to practicing ecological stewardship through sound building science; the data we collect and analyze tells the story of each building and site and guides our conclusions and recommendations. Our team is passionate in its commitment to preserving the existing building stock, while designing new buildings to the highest performance levels possible.

We believe the assessment and planning phase during the FSAM process provides a critical opportunity for our team to have a considerable, positive impact on the future of a building/site and the people who manage and use them. During assessment and planning, our team analyzes and evaluates:
• the life cycle of the building and its respective systems;  
• recommended capital investment projects, including budgets, cost effectiveness, functionality, usability, safety, energy efficiency, sustainability, etc.

While our team is experienced in the design phase, our passion is in developing initial facility management plans to address each client’s unique needs.

### Example 2 – High‑Performance Home (Finlayson, MN)

The Client intends on creating a new high‑performance home as their private residence on undeveloped land in Finlayson, MN. The address of the new property is 15584 180th Avenue, Finlayson, Minnesota. The home is intended to house the two of them.

The Client’s goals, or Owner Project Requirements (OPR), include designing and building a one‑story ~2,400 SF house plus an attached garage. A 40′ × 60′ shop will be built adjacent to the house, with a possible connector between. The shop will be built first, separately from the home, and is outside the scope of this project. Priorities include fitting contextually into the rural neighborhood, within the existing clearing with the best view to the south and east. There are a number of larger trees on the property that should be preserved, sacrificing the newer growth birch and alder as needed. The site should accommodate three RVs near the shop. The site and home are to be as universally accessible as possible with all areas to be walker/wheelchair‑friendly. They would like to design the home now, and do the site preparation in the fall of 2024, with construction in 2025.

### Example 3 – HVAC System Design (Duluth Fire Hall #1)

Our objective is to design a state‑of‑the‑art HVAC system that meets your specific needs and exceeds industry standards in energy efficiency and performance for the remodel project located at City of Duluth Fire Hall #1. Implementing a high‑performance HVAC system in your project will provide numerous benefits, including energy savings, enhanced comfort, indoor air quality, environmental sustainability, and system longevity and reliability.

### Example 4 – Community Center Insulation & Mechanical Modernization

We understand that Morgan Park Community Center is moving forward with additional roof insulation and mechanical system replacement. The City has requested professional services from CR‑Building Performance Specialists, GBC (CR‑BPS) as described in this letter proposal. The design work is to take place in the Winter of 2024–25 with construction during the summer and fall of 2025.

### Example 5 – Townhouse Water‑Leak Diagnostics (Minneapolis, MN)

You, the owners of the townhouse at 16 Melbourne Ave SE, Minneapolis, MN 55414, have reported persistent wintertime water leakage from the living room’s vaulted ceiling. This issue remains despite recent re‑roofing and ceiling insulation work. CR‑BPS understands the leakage may be caused by air exfiltration into the ceiling cavity.

Warm, moist air can enter these cavities and condense when it contacts colder surfaces, potentially freezing and then melting, leading to water intrusion. CR‑BPS will conduct diagnostic testing, including blower door testing (ASTM E1186), and infrared thermography to identify the sources of air leakage within the ceiling assembly. Our findings will be documented in a thermography report.

### Example 6 – High‑Performance Cabin (La Pointe, WI)

The Client intends on creating a new high‑performance cabin as their private residence on undeveloped land in La Pointe, WI. The address of the new property is 2343 Hagen Road, La Pointe, WI 54850. The home is intended to house the Client and his son. The extent of use is still undetermined but could be vacant for long periods of time.

The Client’s goals, or Owner Project Requirements (OPR), include designing and building a two‑story 1,500 SF to 2,500 SF cabin plus an attached carport for one or two vehicles, with a separate workshop. The cabin will have three bedrooms, one and a half bathrooms, with an attached screened porch. Mike would like to design the home starting now and have the site preparation start this fall, leading into construction of the cabin beginning spring of 2025; to be confirmed and coordinated with Builder’s schedule.

a. Basics: 3 Bed, 1 ½ bath, two‑story, ground‑level master bedroom and full bath; two second‑story bedrooms and ½ bath; wraparound screened porch on the lakeside; large detached workshop. Cabin is expected to be between 1,500 and 2,500 SF.  
b. May include a basement.  
c. Protected parking with at least one attached, covered stall and direct entry.  
d. Detached 800–1,200 SF workshop designed to complement the cabin.  
e. Materials and systems selected for long‑term durability.  
f. Resilient design for severe climate change impacts (wind, snow, hail, wildfire smoke).  
g. Very low heating/cooling loads and minimal operating energy demand.  
h. Compact, efficient, highly functional floorplan emphasizing craftsmanship.  
i. Preference for simple, elegant solutions in both form and systems.  
j. Low‑maintenance exterior and systems.  
k. Future‑proofed electrical and mechanical capacity.  
l. Rodent, bat, and small‑animal proof construction and detailing.  
m. Excellent indoor air quality; low‑VOC materials; effective kitchen exhaust.  
n. ADA‑minded ground‑floor accessibility.  
o. Ability to be mothballed without energy input and withstand freezing.  
p. Wood‑stove heating strategy modeled for various operating phases.

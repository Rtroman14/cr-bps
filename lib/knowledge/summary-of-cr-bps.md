#### How They Work

**Every engagement follows CR‑BPS’s four‑phase loop—**_Plan → Design → Build → Last_**—so performance gains are baked in from discovery through post‑occupancy.**  
*Plan* — data‑rich research and risk‑finding  
*Design* — architecture fused with building‑science rigor  
*Build* — precision execution that balances client goals and ecological prudence  
*Last* — long‑term stewardship, commissioning, and knowledge transfer

These excerpts show how past CR‑BPS proposals frame the **“Project Understanding”** section. They demonstrate the firm’s practice of: (1) restating the client’s goals and context, (2) signaling CR‑BPS’s relevant expertise, and (3) setting the stage for the Scope of Services. Use them as style and structure references when drafting new proposals.

MnDOT has requested that CR-BPS provide Building Enclosure Commissioning (BECx) professional services to support MnDOT’s commissioning for this project. The BECx will follow the B3 requirement. This project also is required to comply with Minnesota’s Energy Code and the commissioning requirements in Minnesota’s B3 version 3.2r01.. This structured quality assurance process will verify that the building delivered meets MnDOT’s requirements for the building enclosure as spelled out in the RFP. This will include developing a Building Envelope Commissioning Plan and working with the Commissioning Authority through all stages of design and construction. We will provide the necessary deliverables at each milestone of the project outlined in detail within this proposal.

The project site is the new MnDOT Virginia Headquarters located at 101 Hoover Road North in Virginia, MN. The Headquarters Building is currently programmed to be approximately 180,000 square feet and will be the primary focus for Building Envelope Commissioning on this project.

## Example 5 - Integrated Inventory & Facility Condition Assessment

CR-BPS is an industry leader in conducting an Integrated Inventory & Facility Condition Assessments. We are dedicated to practicing ecological stewardship through sound building science; the data we collect and analyze tells the story of each building and site and guides our conclusions and recommendations. Our team is passionate in its commitment to preserving the existing building stock, while designing new buildings to the highest performance levels possible.

We believe the assessment and planning phase during an Integrated Inventory & Facility Condition Assessment process provides a critical opportunity for our team to have a considerable, positive impact on the future of a building/site and the people who manage and use them. During assessment and planning, our team analyzes and evaluates:

-   the life cycle of the building and its respective systems;
-   recommended capital investment projects, including budgets, cost effectiveness, functionality, usability, safety, energy efficiency, sustainability, etc.

While our team is experienced in the design phase, our passion is in developing initial facility management plans to address each client’s unique needs.

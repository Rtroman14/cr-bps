CR-BPS asks to be escorted by a COUNCIL Facilities Team Representative during the onsite assessment (preferably the building manager or operations director) for building access and building maintenance and operation history.

**DELIVERABLES:**
COUNCIL to provide:

-   Facilities Team contact information
-   On-Site Assessment escort and staff for interview

### TASK 4: DEVELOP ASSET CONDITION SCORES

(1) Meeting – Review Session

After creating a Revit BIM model of the asset, completing the onsite physical inspection, and developing respective building and campus legends, CR-BPS will enter all facility and site data into CR-BPS’ licensed software tool. Each identified system will be documented using a UniFormat classification of systems, and given a cost based on RS Means. CR-BPS will fully customize this tool to the COUNCIL’s standards, protocols and unique situation. This data will belong to the COUNCIL, and if requested in a different format (opposed to online) may be exported to other formats (Excel, .csv, PDF, etc.). CR-BPS uses the VFA asset management software tool to organize, manage and report all facility data. This tool is an “In-House” offering CR-BPS offers the COUNCIL. If the COUNCIL requests their own license of this software, CR-BPS will coordinate with VFA accordingly.

Please note: CR-BPS is a “Solutions Partner” with VFA – we find this a suitable software for our ACA and Asset Management needs. CR-BPS does not benefit financially from the COUNCIL’s use of the VFA software – it is simply our preferred tool based on our past experience. CR-BPS is willing to utilize a different Asset Management Tool per the COUNCIL’s request.

Once all data has been entered into the software tool CR-BPS will host a Review Session with the COUNCIL to go over the preliminary findings. This also provides the opportunity to brainstorm, discuss, and begin to fine-tune the assumptions and data collected, based on the COUNCIL’s goals, priorities, budget, etc. This approach assures all facility improvement opportunities are considered; thus, recommendations reach maximum benefits.

These Review Sessions are critical in determining the most viable course of action for building improvements, and obtaining COUNCIL opinions, ideas and comments. Review Sessions include brainstorming on issues such as, but not limited to:

-   System renewal and replacement actions
-   Verifying Renewal Costs and Current Replacement Value for all Systems
-   Establish defendable capital plans and budgets (Example: 20 yr. CIP)
-   Identify special project considerations

**DELIVERABLES:**
COUNCIL to provide:

-   Facilities Team contact information
-   Staff time for Idea Gathering Workshop (approx. 2 days per round)
-   Comments on Findings

**CR-BPS to provide:**

-   On-Site Assessment Notes as requested
-   Populated VFA Asset Management Tool

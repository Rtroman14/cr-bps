1. SCOPE OF SERVICES  
   **Task 1 – Coordinate and Collect (Project Kick‑Off Meeting)**  
    CR‑BPS will collect and review all available background information including, but not limited to: drawings, past studies, building history, maintenance and operation manuals, etc.  
    The Client and CR‑BPS will conduct a Project Kick‑Off meeting. The goal of this meeting is to:  
    • Review background information  
    • Present and review schedule  
    • Customize Asset Management software (VFA Facility) data entry standards and protocols to align with County’s standards  
    • Identify other organizational goals

**Task 2 – On‑site Assessments & Department Interviews**  
CR‑BPS’s Facility and Energy Assessors will conduct an on‑site, physical inspection of each asset. The CR‑BPS team will also conduct interviews with County departments. CR‑BPS shall be escorted by a County Facilities Team representative – preferably the building manager or operations/maintenance supervisor – for building access and interviews.

**Task 3 – Data Entry**  
CR‑BPS will enter all facility and energy data into the FSAM software tool.  
For this project, the County will use CR‑BPS’s in‑house FSAM software tool (VFA license). If the County prefers to purchase their own license, CR‑BPS will facilitate negotiations and purchase agreements as needed. Note: CR‑BPS does not benefit financially from the County’s purchase of VFA.

**Task 4 – Verify and Review of Data/Findings**  
CR‑BPS to meet with the County to review all information and verify that all data is correct and accurately represented. CR‑BPS will seek County approval of this data before moving forward.

**Task 5 – Analyze the Data (Brainstorming – IDEAS Sessions)**  
We have the data – now what?  
CR‑BPS staff will meet with the County to evaluate and analyze all data collected for each asset. A Whole‑Systems Thinking approach (including life‑cycle analysis) will be used to assure all facility improvement considerations reach maximum benefits. IDEAS Sessions are valuable in determining the most viable course of action for building improvements including, but not limited to:  
• Review of the facility conditions for the asset  
• Discuss priority deficiencies and strategies to improve/fix  
• Evaluate funding scenarios based upon improvement strategies  
• Establish defendable capital plans and budgets (Example: 20 Year CIP)  
• Identify special project considerations  
• Identify investment opportunities

**Task 6 – Fully Populated Asset Management Program – Final Deliverable**  
Due to the dynamic nature of this FSAM process, we anticipate customizing final deliverables to the Client’s needs. As we work through this process, we will uncover what deliverables will best serve the Client in the short and long term. Thus, minimum deliverables are listed below, and may be changed based on mutual consent.  
Final Deliverable:

1. Fully populated FSAM tool for each asset
2. Executive Summary Report including:  
   a. Asset Information  
   b. System Information  
   c. Requirement Information  
   d. Funding Needs Information (5/10/20+ year Capital Plan)  
   e. Special Project Considerations

**Task 7 – Ongoing Services: Three Year Agreement**  
CR‑BPS staff will meet with the County, update the facility data, and provide updated reporting once a year over the next three years (2024–2026). The scope of the Ongoing Services will be as follows:  
• A two‑hour virtual meeting with County staff and CR‑BPS staff to review and discuss annual updates to the facilities.  
• CR‑BPS will provide the appropriate updates, based on the information gathered in the annual meeting, within the FSAM software.  
• CR‑BPS will provide updated facility reports once a year for each of the three years of ongoing services (2024, 2025, 2026).
